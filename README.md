# Portfolio

##Currently learning frameworks.

My intention with this project is to showcase what I bring, what I can do, my aesthetic taste, & design intuition.
This is currently a work in progress and isn't 100% responsive.

**It is best viewed on devices with a width of 450px or wider.**

**There is a lot of video content that auto-loads & auto-plays.**
I have a complete idea to address this, but I need a little more understanding of javascript before I can tackle it.

# **Everything you see here is self taught.**
**I am most interested in the user experience & interaction**, so please do not judge me on the code alone, there is so much to learn & master.



## Thank you for your time
